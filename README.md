# A collection of helpful Google Tag Manager Templates

To use the templates, just import them into your Google Tag Manager Container.

To do so, navigate to the template-section and click on "New".
After that you will find a Menu (three dots) on the right hand side. Simply open that menu and choose "import" and done!

# Facebook Pixel
A Simple Template to include a Facebook Pixel to a website. You can give the User an option to opt-out from Pixel-Tracking by using a cookie.
You can either create a script yourself (as a custom html tag) or use the upcoming Facebook Opt-Out Template.

For now, the cookie has to be named 'fb-disable' and hold the value 'true'. But with a bit of knowledge you can change the cookie name and required content to anything you like. Just be warned not to forget to modify the cookie name ("allowed cookie names") in the permissions tab. Otherwise the sandboxed Javascript will not be able to read from your cookie.
